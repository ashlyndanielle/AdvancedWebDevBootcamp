  X_XML

  * AJAX is an approach to web development
  * a concept/way of building websites

  * With AJAX websites can send and request data from a server *in the background*
  * without disturbing the current page
  * this lead to single page apps and frameworks

*** XML and JSON ***
  formats used to send data through API's

  *XML* extended markup language
    sytactically similar to HTML
  *JSON* JavaScript Object Notation
    looks (almost) exactly like a javaScript object

*** MAKING REQUESTS WITH JAVASCRIPT ***

  1. XMLHTTP Request ( XHR )
  2. Fetch API
  3. 3rd Party Libraries:
      - jQuery
      - Axios

  *XHR Request Issues*
    ugly, bulky syntax
    16 years old
    no streaming support

  *FETCH API*
    replacement/update to XHR
    *cleaner* and allows more functionality
